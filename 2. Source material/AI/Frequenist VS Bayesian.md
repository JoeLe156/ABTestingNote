### **Key Differences Between Bayesian and Frequentist A/B Testing**

| Aspect                   | Frequentist A/B Testing                                                     | Bayesian A/B Testing                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Philosophy**           | Based on fixed probabilities and long-run frequencies.                      | Incorporates prior beliefs and updates them with data.                            |
| **Output**               | Provides p-values and confidence intervals.                                 | Provides probability distributions and credible intervals.                        |
| **Decision Making**      | Requires pre-defined sample size and significance levels.                   | Allows continuous monitoring and decision making.                                 |
| **Stopping Rules**       | Requires sticking to the fixed sample size or risking bias.                 | Can stop at any point without compromising validity.                              |
| **Interpretation**       | Results answer “Is the observed effect unlikely under the null hypothesis?” | Results answer “What is the probability that Variant B is better than Variant A?” |
| **Use Case Flexibility** | Designed for binary outcomes (reject/accept null hypothesis).               | Supports a broader range of probabilistic insights.                               |
