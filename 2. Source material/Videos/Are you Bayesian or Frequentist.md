# Are you Bayesian or Frequentist?

What has been said in the video from the experiment of coin tossing, when the coin alerady landed
1. Frequenist:
	- My guess about the probability of the coin landing head or tail doesn't matter, because it's already landed, there is no probability now, only one truth. It's just that my answer is correct or not.
	- I have a favorite and default action. If I were to repeat the experiment and collect enough data, would the evidence be convincing enough for me to continue/stop taking the action?
	- If i were to repeat this procedure many many many many times, some of those times, i would guess correctly, some of those times i wouldn't. if i guessed heads, i would get it right 50% of the time, if i did it FREQUENT-ly many times.
1. Bayesian
	- They take a starting opinion, they see some evidence they get a new opinion that's still their opinion, doesn't matter if that opinion has nothing to do with everyone else's opinion it's just a sensible way of updating your opinion with data. What are the chances that my method gives me the wrong answer
	- The first coin landing, my opinion/belief about it being head/tail would be 50%. And then I would adjust my opinion about it along the way after incorporating facts might change my opinion about the probability of the next event
