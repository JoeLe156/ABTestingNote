# Frequenist approach to AB testing

The frequentist approach in a coin-toss experiment is a theory of probability that focuses on the frequency of an event occurring in repeated trials. In this approach, the probability of an event is understood as the long-run relative frequency of its occurrence when the experiment is repeated an infinite number of times.

For example, let's consider flipping a fair coin. The frequentist approach would state that the probability of getting heads is 0.5 because, in the long run, if we were to flip the coin many times, we would expect heads to appear approximately half the time.

In this framework, the frequency of outcomes determines our probability assessment. The more trials we conduct, the closer the relative frequency will approach the actual probability. The idea is that by conducting numerous repetitions of the experiment, we gain more confidence in our estimates of probabilities.

Overall, the frequentist approach relies on conducting repeated experiments and observing the frequencies of outcomes to estimate probabilities, treating probability as a concept associated with the long-term behavior of a process.
