# Methods to approach AB tests

### 1. The main differences
Below are differences used for practical AB test decision making

|                       | Frequenist                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Bayesian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Analysis method       | 1. Frequenists conduct their analysis based on the assumption that with large enough sample size, the observed sample statistics eventually converge to the mean (this is its connection to the [[central limit theorem]])<br><br>2. Predefined sample size, significant level and runtime.<br><br>3. Hypothesis testing | 1. Bayesian is more flexible with the sample size and runtime. They have a built-in mechanism to incorporate new data to their prior belief and update the belief reasonably along the way. And they can stop the experiment as soon as they are confident about the result.<br><br>2. Estimating the [[posterior distributions]] of the metrics of interest (e.g: CVR) for each variant. |
| Statistical test      | Frequently utilize traditional and simple tests, such as z-test or t-test                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The math is more complex. It utilizes concepts like [[posterior distributions]] estimation, [[probability of superiority]], [[expected loss calculation]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Output                | p-value, confidence interval                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | probability distribution, credible interval                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Result interpretation | Conclusion are stated revolving [[p-value]], e.g.: 5% chance of observing this result under null hypothesis => harder for stakeholders to interpret the results                                                                                                                                                          | Easier to communicate results, such as "Thereâ€™s a 95% probability that Variant B increases booking rates." This might align better with business stakeholders who prioritize actionable insights                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Scale of test         | Handle simple A/B tests with high traffic quite well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Better at handling complex A/B tests (like [[multivariate tests]], prior knowledge...) with limited traffic. E.g.: testing seat-selection while considering route-specific preferences                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Statistics concept    | Estimate the maximum likelihood of the $\mu$, aka $\hat\mu$ which is a point estimate.<br>This approach treats the params as if they were fixed but unknown. The estimates are our best guess.                                                                                                                           | The Bayesian asks: Point estimate is limited. Instead of a point estimate, what is the distribution? What is p($\mu$\|data)?<br>And thanks to distribution, we can answer question like: what is the probability A is better than B?<br>Treat the params as random variables                                                                                                              |

Frequenist approach seems to be more popular atm, due to its simplicity. However, there is a rising trend towards Bayesian method thanks to its advancements listed above.
