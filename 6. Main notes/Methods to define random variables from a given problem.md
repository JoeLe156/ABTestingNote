# Method to define random variables from a given problem - Learn by practicing
## Practice 1
[[Probability concepts#Time to practice#Problem 1]]
Side notes:
1. The number of values [[Joint distribution]] increases exponentially when adding more random variables to the whole problem => this is bad because we need exponentially more values to get closer to the accurate estimate of the probability [[the curse of dimensionality]]

## Practice 2 - Decide if 2 random variables are independent
[[Probability concepts#Independent variables]]
